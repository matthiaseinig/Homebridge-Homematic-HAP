# Integration guide

## Prerequisites

| Item | Minimum |
| ---- | ------- |
| Homebridge | 1.8 (also runs on 2.0 beta) |
| Node.js | 20.18 / 22.10 / 24.0 (LTS lines) |
| CCU firmware | RaspberryMatic 3.65 or recent CCU3 firmware |
| Network | Plugin host and CCU must be on the same routable subnet |

The plugin only talks to the CCU over the **LAN**. It does not need
internet access. It does not contact any of the author's servers, send
analytics, or auto-update.

## CCU user / role

The plugin authenticates to the CCU via the modern JSON-RPC API
(`/api/homematic.cgi`, `Session.login`). It needs a CCU user account
with the **Admin** role. *User* role is not enough — the JSON-RPC
endpoints we call (`Device.listAllDetail`, `SysVar.setBool`, etc.) are
gated to Admin.

A few things to get right when creating the user:

- **Don't enable Auto-Login on this user.** Auto-Login is an IP-based
  short-circuit for browser sessions; users configured that way often
  have no separately-stored password hash that `Session.login` can
  validate against, and the JSON-RPC API rejects every credential.
  Create a regular Admin user with a real password.
- Verify the password works by signing in to the CCU's WebUI in an
  *incognito* window before pasting it into the plugin config. If the
  WebUI login succeeds, the JSON-RPC call will too.
- A dedicated service user (e.g. `homebridge`) is cleaner than reusing
  the human `admin` account.

## Network requirements

| Direction | Port | Protocol | Why |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | --- |
| Plugin → CCU | 80 / 443 | JSON-RPC over HTTP(S) | discovery, variables, programs, rooms, getValue/setValue (control plane) |
| Plugin → CCU | 2001 | XML-RPC | BidCos-RF event subscription + fast `setValue` |
| Plugin → CCU | 2010 | XML-RPC | HmIP-RF event subscription + fast `setValue` |
| Plugin → CCU | 2000 | XML-RPC | BidCos-Wired (optional) |
| Plugin → CCU | 9292 | XML-RPC | VirtualDevices |
| CCU → Plugin | 9875 (default, configurable) | XML-RPC | inbound push events |

If the CCU and Homebridge are not on the same broadcast domain, you
need to **set the event-server bind host explicitly** to a routable
address that the CCU can reach. The default `0.0.0.0` makes the plugin
auto-detect a local IPv4, which works for most home setups.

If you run Homebridge in Docker, the event server port (9875 by
default) must be **published with the host's IP**, not just the
`0.0.0.0` shorthand — otherwise the CCU will try to call back on a
container-internal address it can't reach. Example:

```yaml
ports:
  - "9875:9875"
```

## Configuration

The plugin renders a custom UI in the Homebridge UI; you should rarely
need to edit JSON by hand. For reference, the persisted config block
looks like this:

```json
{
  "platform": "HomematicHap",
  "name": "HomematicHap",
  "ccuIp": "192.168.1.10",
  "useTls": false,
  "interfaces": {
    "bidcosRf": true,
    "hmIpRf": true,
    "bidcosWired": false,
    "virtualDevices": true,
    "cuxd": false
  },
  "ccuAuth": {
    "enabled": false,
    "username": "",
    "password": ""
  },
  "eventServer": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 9875,
    "watchdogSeconds": 300
  },
  "channels": [
    {
      "address": "HmIP.000ABCDEF12345:1",
      "name": "Living Room Light",
      "service": "SwitchAccessory",
      "subtype": "outlet"
    }
  ],
  "variables": [{ "name": "PartyMode" }],
  "programs":  [{ "name": "Wake up" }]
}
```

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `ccuIp` | IP or hostname of the CCU. Both work; hostnames are resolved at start-up. |
| `useTls` | If `true`, ReGa scripts use HTTPS on port 48181. The CCU's self-signed cert is accepted. |
| `interfaces.*` | Toggle per CCU interface. Disable interfaces you don't use to silence warnings on hosts that block those ports. |
| `ccuAuth.enabled` | Set to `true` if your CCU requires Basic auth on the WebUI. The credentials never leave `config.json` and are never logged. |
| `eventServer.host` | Address the CCU should call back. `0.0.0.0` auto-detects. Set explicitly when running in Docker or behind multiple NICs. |
| `eventServer.port` | Default 9875. Pick anything in 1024–65535. |
| `eventServer.watchdogSeconds` | If no events arrive for this long, every interface re-subscribes. Default 300 s. |
| `channels[]` | Per-channel HomeKit mapping, see service registry below. |
| `variables[]` | CCU variables exposed as Switch (boolean) / Lightbulb (numeric). |
| `programs[]` | CCU programs exposed as a single-shot Switch. |

### Service registry

| `service` key | HAP service(s) | Suitable for | Variants (`subtype`) |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| `SwitchAccessory` | Switch / Outlet / Lightbulb | Binary relays, IP outlets | `switch`, `outlet`, `lightbulb` |
| `DimmerAccessory` | Lightbulb (with Brightness) | Dimmable lights | – |
| `BlindAccessory` | WindowCovering | Roller shutters, blinds | – |
| `ThermostatAccessory` | Thermostat | Radiator and IP wall thermostats | – |
| `ContactAccessory` | ContactSensor / Door / Window | Door & window contacts | `contact`, `door`, `window` |
| `MotionAccessory` | MotionSensor | Motion + IR detectors | – |
| `SmokeAccessory` | SmokeSensor | Homematic smoke detectors | – |
| `LeakAccessory` | LeakSensor | Water-detection sensors | – |
| `TemperatureAccessory` | TemperatureSensor | Climate / weather channels | – |
| `HumidityAccessory` | HumiditySensor | Climate / weather channels | – |

For variables, the plugin auto-picks `VariableSwitchAccessory` for
boolean variables and `VariableLightAccessory` for numeric ones (with
the variable's min/max as the Brightness range).

## Security

- Run Homebridge as a **dedicated, non-root user**, the way the
  Homebridge installer does by default.
- `config.json` is plain JSON. Make sure it is `chmod 600` and owned by
  the Homebridge user.
- The plugin writes its own state under `<homebridge-storage>/homebridge-homematic-hap/`.
  No file outside that directory is opened by the plugin.
- The custom UI is reachable only through the Homebridge UI itself;
  the plugin does not open any extra TCP/HTTP listeners. Do not expose
  the Homebridge UI to the public internet.

See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.

## Troubleshooting

**The CCU is reachable but discovery is empty.**
Check that the CCU's WebUI Settings → Security do not have *Authenticate
internal access* set without ticking the "Use CCU authentication"
option in this plugin too.

**Devices show up but never update in real time.**
Check the EventServer port. The CCU's *Status & Maintenance → Service
Messages* page lists registered RPC clients — your callback URL should
be there. If it isn't, there's a routing or NAT issue between CCU and
Homebridge.

**"No RPC client for interface X"**
The interface failed to subscribe at startup (often because the port is
firewalled or the CCU has that interface disabled). Either enable the
interface on the CCU or untoggle it in the plugin's interface list.

**Variables seem to lag.**
Variables are polled every 60 s. The CCU does not push variable
updates through the RPC channel reliably. There is no fix on our side.

**Heavy log spam from `[HomematicHap:ccu:events]`**
Set `--debug` off — at default verbosity, only errors and reconnects
log.
